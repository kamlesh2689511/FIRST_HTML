<h2>top 5 movies details of 2018 in bollywood</h2>
<hr>

<h3>1. Kgf </h3>
<p>KGF exceeded all of my expectations.. There isn't really a love element in the film to spoil it too much.. 
    I found the entire movie held my interest.. this will definitely be the film you're looking for..
    This film has numerous memorable scenes that verge on the hysterical including the yash in the gold Fields..
    Neel as a director is mind blowing and his secret, I believe, is his obvious respect for his audience,. 
    Prashanth Neel And Rocking Star yash deserve a standing ovation.. I will always be remembered this.

<h3> 2. BahuBali</h3>

    little do they know the background of the infant or what the future holds for him. The kid grows up to as
    Shivudu, a free-spirit wanting to explore the mountains and in the process learns of his roots and then 
    realizes the whole purpose of his life and ends up confronting the mighty Bhallala Deva!

<h3>3. salaar</h3>
<p> The fate of a violently contested kingdom hangs on the fraught bond between two friends-turned-foes in this
saga of power, bloodshed and betrayal.

<h3>4. padman</h3>
<p>Biography of Tamil Nadu activist Arunachalam Muruganantham, whose mission was to provide sanitary
napkins to poor women of rural areas who used rags or leaves because sanitary napkins were rare. 
After he did not get fruitful results from his family and a medical college he approached, 
he decided to try it himself by filling a football bladder with goat's blood and roaming around with it for 
a day to check the absorption rate of the sanitary napkins he made.

<h3> 5. kantaara</h3>
<p>Depicting Supreme God Vishnu's third incarnation on earth called Varaha avatar.
The forest tribal community devote to Varaha and considers Bhootha Kola (divine dance of coastal Karnataka)
performer to Rudra (Lord Shiva) who is gatekeeper of the community and protects every devotee of Lord Varaha 
from evil spirits (living/dead). A promise of ancestors is under threat to be breached by people over lust of 
materialistic gains where the ancient King had made deal with demigods as bargain for his peace. 
With such powerful story line, excellent performance by every actor keeping raw background showing beautiful
traditional practices of coastal Karnataka in an ultimate showdown of good vs evil.
